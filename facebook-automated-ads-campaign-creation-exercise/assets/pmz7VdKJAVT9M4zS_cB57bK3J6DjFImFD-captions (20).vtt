00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.509
The only thing we have to set up here is the
budget allocation.

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.460
Keep in mind that we should have ten campaigns
in total, and we want to optimize across all

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.240
ten.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.449
So we need to enable Predictive Budget Allocation
between multiple campaigns.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.110
And for that, we need to create a budget pool,
so let’s do that by opening the link in

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.400
a separate tab.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.320
Here in our library, we create a new budget
pool.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.310
Then we give it a name.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.230
We want to set up the Predictive Budget Allocation
to optimize towards conversions for “Landing

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.440
Page views”, and the budget is a fixed total.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.840
Therefore, the pool will simply contain the
budget of all the campaigns we add.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.239
And that’s it.

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.160
Now our budget pool is created.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.219
So we need to save our campaign as a draft,
and then we can safely reload this tab and

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.640
select the budget pool we just created.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.559
That’s it for the optimization.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.210
In the Tracking tab, we need to update the
URL parameters according to the briefing.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:17.110
Be sure to replace the % placeholders with
the # used by Smartly.io.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.180
And now it’s time to create our campaign.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.770
The campaign processing can take seconds to
minutes, so we’ll just have to wait that

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.270
out.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.260
That’s it.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.299
Our campaign is successfully created.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:41.280
If we refresh the tab, we can see our ad sets
and ads.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:50.810
As we can see, our ad sets are named after
the cities, and if we open them, we see our

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.630
ads named after the weather conditions.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.990
One final thing to quality control is the
correct ad status.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.189
We can do that in our campaign view.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:10.840
What you are looking for is that not all your
ads have the same status.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.379
For example, in Chicago, the “Rainy” ad
is enabled, while all the others are disabled.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.719
Now you would be done with this exercise,
but here’s some bonus content: I’ll show

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:27.719
you how easy it would be to create the campaigns
for the other countries.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.079
We just clone this campaign.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.329
Use the initial state.

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:39.760
And adjust the country in the feed filtering.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.609
Since we use a naming macro in the campaign
name, we don’t even have to touch that - it

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.819
updates automatically.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.129
In this case, it changes to “United Kingdom”.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.689
The other settings we don’t even have to
touch at all.

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.519
So we could hit the “Create Campaign”
button and repeat this process for the other

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.079
countries.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.189
Once you’ve done the work for the first
campaign creating the additional ones is super

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.139
quick and easy.

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.359
And that concludes our exercise.

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:08.349
Thank you for watching.
