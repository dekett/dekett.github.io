00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:15.920
The quickest way is to find and clone the&nbsp;
template we just created and then edit it.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.640
In this clone, we only need&nbsp;
to change a few things.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.400
Let’s start with the top text and&nbsp;
change it to {{video_cold_top}}.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:42.480
And then the bottom text to {{video_cold_bottom}}.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:57.840
It’s also good to replace the mockup with the cold&nbsp;
version to see what we’re supposed to achieve.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.360
In this version, we’re starting with&nbsp;
a black background and a white logo.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.080
And then a white slider drops in.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.840
And that’s it.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.600
We don’t even have the glow-variant&nbsp;
of the shoe to deal with here.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.720
So let’s make those adjustments.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.240
First, we need our black background, and it&nbsp;
needs to be on stage from 0 to 5 seconds.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:39.840
Then instead of our black logo, we need the white&nbsp;
logo, again for the total 5-second duration.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.080
We don’t need the glowing shoe at all.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.200
And instead of our black slider,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.160
we need the white one.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.400
It needs to be on stage for 5 seconds and&nbsp;
get a 1-second intro slide animation from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.840
the top and a 1-second outro&nbsp;
slide animation to the bottom.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.280
Once more, we need to make sure that&nbsp;
the shoe is in the correct layer order.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.160
And we can see that we cannot see our text.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.360
Why?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.760
Because it has the wrong color.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.840
The text should be black.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.840
Let’s address that.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.080
Also for the bottom text.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.840
And finally, don’t forget to pick&nbsp;
the audio file for this version.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.120
Let’s take a final look.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.160
Great, that’s it for the cold version.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.840
We can now rename and then save it.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:46.240
And now, one more time. Let’s clone the&nbsp;
template we just created and then edit it.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:59.840
First, we’ll import the mockup&nbsp;
video for the rain version.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.880
This version has a white background and a&nbsp;
grey logo, and then a gray layer slides in.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.840
We’re going to disable the black background.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.920
We need a gray logo for 5 seconds.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.840
Then disable the white logo.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.560
The white slider also needs to go.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.880
And the gray slider should be unhidden and&nbsp;
on stage for 5 seconds with a 1-second intro&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.840
slide animation from the top and a 1-second&nbsp;
outro slide animation to the bottom.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.280
Finally, the top text needs to be white again.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.720
Our bottom text too.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.880
And we need to change the texts to&nbsp;
{{video_rainy_bottom}} and {{video_rainy_top}}.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.240
Let’s take a final look.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.840
White background and gray&nbsp;
logo, gray slider drops in.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.960
The text matches the rain topic.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.920
And at the end, the gray logo appears again.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.840
Now, one last time, let’s change&nbsp;
the audio for the template.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.880
Let’s rename and save it, and we’re finally&nbsp;
done with all three template versions.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.960
As you can see, most of the time is spent&nbsp;
on getting an overview of the assets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.160
the task at hand, and then&nbsp;
getting the first template right.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.400
But after that, you can clone it&nbsp;
and only need a few adjustments.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.880
If you now have your 3 template versions ready to&nbsp;
go, you can continue to the next and final step:

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.520
We’re going to build our campaign.
