00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.550
Hello and welcome to our campaign creation
assignment.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.049
Before we get started, one note:

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:13.209
This feed is just an example how a feed for
a campaign like this could look like.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.110
If you’re going to build your own at some
point in the future, it might have additional

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.820
columns or might be missing some; the columns
might be named differently, and so on.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.010
The basic concepts, however, should apply
to any similar location-based campaign.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.530
With that being said, you can download the
feed file for this assignment and then open

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.649
it in an app of your choice, for example,
in Numbers or Excel.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.660
I have it here in Google Spreadsheets, but
with additional formatting for clarity.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.839
Let’s take a look around.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.390
In column A we have our ID field.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.749
That’s needed for both Automated and Dynamic
Ads and has to be unique.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:58.469
If we scroll down, we can see that we have
50 cities or “products”.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.979
In column B, we have our city names, and column
C includes local names that might differ from

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.930
the English names.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.140
Then we have a region for the cities, e.g.,
England or California.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.410
In column E, we have the country, ten countries
in total.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.900
In column F, we have all this location information
merged into one column that can be used for

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.130
Facebook’s targeting, such as “New York,
New York, United States” or “London, England,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.920
United Kingdom”.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.780
The next column includes our audience size,
which calculates our daily budget relative

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.040
to the audience size.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.650
That daily budget is, of course, in column
H, daily_budget.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.920
This OW_ID in column I is not relevant for
you.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.100
It’s used to match each city to the OpenWeatherMap
API to get the correct weather for each city.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.690
Column J defines the language of the ad copy
used for each city.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.530
Then we have the main weather condition, which
is used to determine if it’s raining in

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:10.080
a city or not.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.910
Right now, we can see that at the time of
this recording, it’s raining in Houston,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.840
Texas, and a few other cities like Montreal.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.710
This column L tells us straightforwardly whether
it’s raining in a city, TRUE or FALSE.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.930
Columns M and N contain the temperature in
Celsius and Fahrenheit, whichever you prefer.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.840
And column O, cold, tells us if this temperature
is considered cold or not.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.190
At the moment, Chicago is below 10°C or 50°F,
which we consider cold.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.610
The same applies to a few cities in the UK
and Canada.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.270
Moving on, we have both our sunrise and sunset
times.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.200
Based on those the column R calculates if
it’s right now after sunset and before sunrise.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.530
Los Angeles, for example, is still at night.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.000
It’s also already night in Australia and
day in the UK.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.990
Finally, we can see when the weather data
was last updated, which should be somewhat

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.320
current.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.319
In the columns following T, we have our ad
texts.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.410
This campaign uses texts in the local language
of each city, and all texts are included here.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.180
They consist of the copies for the videos
and the ad texts themselves, like the message

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.940
or description.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.840
You could also adjust URLs, Call-to-Actions,
and other elements.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.100
And that concludes our rundown of the feed
file.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.560
The next step will be to integrate this sheet
into Smartly.io, so let’s do that now.
