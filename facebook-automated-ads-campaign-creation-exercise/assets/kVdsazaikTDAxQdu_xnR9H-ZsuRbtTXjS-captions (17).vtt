00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.200
Now that our video templates are ready to
go, we can finally build our Automated Ads

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.790
campaign.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.880
To recap, you need to have an ad account and
a Facebook page available for testing.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.710
It’s also a good idea to re-read the campaign
briefing before getting started.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.380
Click on your ad account, then on the “Create”
button, select “New Campaign” and “Automated

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.460
Ads Campaign”.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.870
In the first step, we need to search and select
our feed again.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.820
Below that, you can find the feed filtering
options.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.300
Here you can narrow your campaign down to
only use the cities from a single country,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.730
as is required in the brief.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.170
Click on “Add condition” and then set
up a filter for “country” “equals”

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.700
“United States”.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.360
The interface should confirm that the 50 products
(i.e., cities) from your feed have been filtered

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.250
down to just 5 - the ones in the United States.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.439
In the Campaign tab, we start with giving
our campaign a name.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:24.590
You can mix static elements with naming macros
for the campaign, ad set, and ad names.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.979
For example, “Social_SmartShoe_Launch_#country#”.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.939
While macros with ALL CAPS refer to campaign
settings you specifically make, you can also

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.310
use any column from your feed in Automated
Ads campaigns as a naming macro.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.880
So we just use the “country” column from
our feed, which you can see in the preview,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.389
and which is then replaced with “United
States” in the final name.

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:53.310
Our campaign is supposed to run for 30 days,
so we need to set that up.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.619
The Facebook objective can stay as “Link
Clicks”.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.649
The campaign structure is hugely important
for Automated Ads, but Smartly.io actually

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.920
tries to help you with this setting, so we’ll
revisit this later.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.050
Related to that, we can only properly configure
our budget once our campaign structure is

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.330
in place, so we’ll skip that for now.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.940
According to the briefing, we should optimize
towards “Landing Page views”, so let’s

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.540
set our bidding to that.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.820
“Lowest Cost bidding” can stay the way
it is.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.060
At the bottom, we also need to adjust our
ad set naming.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.990
The client wants to have the city name in
the ad set and the weather condition in the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.720
ad.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.860
We can easily include the city name by referring
to the column “city”, and we’ll use

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.830
#CREATIVE_NAME# for the ad name since we’ll
name our creatives accordingly.
