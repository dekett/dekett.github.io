00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.390
Welcome back to the feed integration.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.590
To complete this course, you need an ad account
where you can test and create campaigns in.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.700
I’m going to use my demo account.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.980
Click on the three dots menu next to your
account and then go to your account settings.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.260
Here you want to select “Feeds for Automated
Ads” in the left-hand menu and then click

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.760
on “Add Product Feed”.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.250
Give your feed a name in the new window and
enter the feed URL.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.510
For this assignment, we provided the URL in
the briefing.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.820
After a while, Smartly.io should have verified
the feed, and we need to select the format.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.760
Our feed is in CSV format, so we select that.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.969
In the next step, Smartly.io is downloading
the feed, which should only take a few seconds.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.399
And now we need to define the product ID,
which in our case is just the “ID” field.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.890
We’re nearly done, but there’s one more
thing.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.000
Click on “Advanced Mode”.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.330
One critical setting here is the “Update
interval”.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.800
By default, we only update the feed once per
day.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.640
If you’re dealing with something like weather
data, which frequently changes, setting this

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.530
to the shortest time frame, “Every hour”,
is recommended.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.530
Now save your settings.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.160
As you can see, the feed is now being downloaded,
and once you reload this page, the feed should

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.560
show that it’s parsed successfully and ready
for campaigns.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.700
And it has found 50 products representing
our 50 cities.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.530
Now that the feed is ready to go, we can build
our video templates based on the feed in the

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.210
next step.
