00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.670
And we can move on to the ad template.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:08.320
Let’s start by giving it a name, in our
case, for one of the weather conditions.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.740
The first thing we’re going to set up is
the status.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.699
This will control that this ad is only active
when it is actually dark in each city.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.900
So our status can’t just be active or paused;
instead, it needs to be controlled from the

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.860
feed.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:34.250
Here we add a new rule, “dark” “equals”
“TRUE”.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.039
Note that this is case-sensitive: Our feed
has these values in upper-case, so we need

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.420
to write it like that.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.609
If we now read the rule, it says: “Keep
the ad active if dark equals TRUE otherwise,

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.399
pause the ad.”

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.310
That sounds exactly like what we want to achieve.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:00.559
Next, be sure to select your Facebook page
intended for testing.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.510
And then we want to create a video ad.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.040
Now we need to remember that all the text
and other ad elements are included in the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.110
feed.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.900
So we just need to reference all these columns
here with our hashtag macros.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.230
The message would be #message_dark#.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.420
We’re going to use a video template.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.310
Make sure you select the correct library where
you stored the templates before.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.580
Most likely, it’s either in the Files library
for the entire company or in a specific ad

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.780
accounts library.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.220
If you’re searching in the wrong library,
you won’t find your templates.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.860
Once you’ve located them, select the matching
template for this creative (e.g., SmartShoe

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.770
Dark).

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.140
Now we can see the preview on the right and
then continue with our other ad elements.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:06.060
The title is #title_dark#, the description
#description_dark#, the call to action is

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:17.060
#cta_dark#, the call to action URL is #url_dark#
and finally the call to action caption is

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.060
#caption_dark#.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.320
And that’s it for our first creative.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.189
Now we can duplicate it and make the adjustments
for the second creative.

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.940
We’ll name it “Cold”.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.590
The status condition is “cold” instead
of “dark”.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.250
The message is #message_cold#.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.600
The template is “SmartShoe Cold”.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.499
And finally the title is #title_cold#, the
description #description_cold#, the call to

00:02:55.499 --> 00:03:07.430
action is #cta_cold#, the call to action URL
is #url_cold# and the call to action caption

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.430
is #caption_cold#.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.060
As you can see, once you’ve set up your
first creative, the following one is relatively

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.069
quick to adjust.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.319
Now we need to repeat this once more for the
“Rainy” creative.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:30.889
Adjust the name to “Rainy”, the status
condition to “rainy”, the message to #message_rainy#,

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.019
and the template to “SmartShoe Rainy”.

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:41.760
And finally the title is #title_rainy#, the
description #description_rainy#, the call

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:50.739
to action is #cta_rainy#, the call to action
URL is #url_rainy# and the call to action

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.349
caption is #caption_cold#.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.799
And now we’re done with all our weather
creatives.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.549
The preview looks great, so let’s move on
to the Optimization tab.
