00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.120
Now let’s take a look at the&nbsp;
different layers we have here.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.480
First, we have the top text&nbsp;
and the top text rasterized.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.960
What is the difference between them?

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.000
The top text is an actual text layer.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.240
However, when these get imported into the template&nbsp;
editor, their font and style might be reset.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.160
We’re also being provided with an image layer of&nbsp;
the text to see how the text is supposed to look.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.080
Then we can edit the text layer accordingly.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.480
The image layer is the bold text we can see here,&nbsp;
but we can also see the very thin text layer.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.440
So we’re going to fix that in a later step.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.520
Then we also have this red&nbsp;
top text safe zone layer.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.080
When creating these dynamic&nbsp;
templates, the designer always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.040
needs to consider the dynamic elements of&nbsp;
the template, in our case, the city name.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.720
City names can, of course, be shorter&nbsp;
or longer than our “New York” example.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.440
By establishing safe zones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.360
the designer can tell us that the text&nbsp;
should always be contained in this box.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.440
Smartly.io will automatically reduce the font&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.160
size should the text get any longer to make&nbsp;
sure it doesn’t spill out of the safe zone.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.000
The same idea applies to the bottom text.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.120
We have the text layer itself, the&nbsp;
rasterized image, and the safe zone.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.880
Then we have our shoe, but we&nbsp;
have two versions: One that glows…

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.840
...and one that doesn’t.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.640
Then we have a couple of sliders, meaning layers&nbsp;
that are supposed have a sliding animation.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.240
One in black, one in grey, and one in white.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.360
Those different versions are needed for&nbsp;
the different versions of this template:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.960
Dark, cold and rainy.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.440
The same goes for our logo; we&nbsp;
have it in white, grey, and black.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.680
And finally, we have a black background&nbsp;
and a white one, whichever is needed.
