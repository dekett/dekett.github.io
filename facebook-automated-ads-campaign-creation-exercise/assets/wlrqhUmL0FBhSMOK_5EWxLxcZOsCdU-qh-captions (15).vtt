00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.960
We’re starting with the top text layer&nbsp;
and, in step 1, correct the font.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.160
The font itself used here is actually&nbsp;
correct; it is supposed to be Lato.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.000
However, the font-variant or&nbsp;
weight isn’t what we need.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.920
It needs to be bold.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.680
That’s starting to look more like what we want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.680
so now let’s make sure we’re using&nbsp;
the entire safe zone for our text box.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.440
That looks good enough for us.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.320
We can now hide the rasterized&nbsp;
layer and the safe zone.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.280
In the next step, let’s repeat the&nbsp;
same for the bottom text layer.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.680
Change the font-weight to bold and make&nbsp;
sure it fills the entire safe zone.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.680
Done.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.840
Now we can disable the bottom&nbsp;
text rasterized and the safe zone.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.400
With the text styles fixed, let’s take&nbsp;
another look at the animations and timings.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.560
As mentioned, pretty much from&nbsp;
the beginning of the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.840
the black slider replaces the white background.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.400
It takes a second to come in.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.840
And at the 4-second-mark, the slider goes&nbsp;
away, which again takes a second to complete.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.200
So let’s grab our black slider&nbsp;
layer and make it visible.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.840
Always be sure to hide the mockup layer at the top&nbsp;
again so that you’re looking at the right content.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.240
Our black slider will be on&nbsp;
stage for the full five seconds.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.840
It also needs a slide intro for 1 second from the&nbsp;
top and a slide outro for 1 second to the bottom.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.840
Now let’s take a look.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.120
Pretty good.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.520
However, here we can already see a problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.840
the black slider goes in front of the shoe, so&nbsp;
let’s bring our shoe layer above the slider.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.400
This is looking much better.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.080
Next step: The top text.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.840
It’s not immediately visible, so let’s say&nbsp;
it comes in around the half-second mark...

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.120
...and is then visible for the entire duration.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.280
And now we enable the fade intro and zoom-in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.000
and both take probably around 1 second.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.760
Let’s see how this looks.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.320
Pretty good.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.600
The bottom text repeats the&nbsp;
same around 1 second later.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.840
So it should be on stage from 1.5 seconds&nbsp;
with a fade-in and zoom-in for 1 second.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.680
It won’t be on stage for the total duration,&nbsp;
but we don’t know exactly yet how long,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.840
so we’ll just set the fade-out&nbsp;
and fix the timing later.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:46.240
This is how it looks now.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.800
What next?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.840
We can see that our shoe disappears.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.760
It shouldn’t be doing that.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.840
So let’s set the time on stage&nbsp;
to 5 seconds for our shoe.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.000
And now, let’s fix our glow-version.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.160
Again looking back at the mockup video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:13.840
we can see that the shoe starts to glow&nbsp;
pretty much at the same time as the top text.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.840
So it should come in around the 0.5-second mark.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.840
And let’s try a Fade for 1 second.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.360
However, it’s not quite right.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.840
Let’s first change the on-stage end to 5 seconds.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.160
And now recheck the original video.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.840
We can see that the shoe&nbsp;
essentially flickers to life.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.960
How can we recreate that?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.480
The solution is in the animation style.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.840
Instead of the default “Smooth 1”&nbsp;
style, we want to have a “Bounce” there.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.760
Now it looks much better, and we&nbsp;
also apply it to the fade-out.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.840
The bottom text gets a 1-second&nbsp;
duration for the intro animation.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.920
And now this part looks pretty good.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.560
But we’re missing our logo at the end.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.960
Let’s adjust our logo on stage to 0-5 seconds.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.360
But now we have an issue here at the end.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.080
The bottom text isn’t gone yet when the logo is&nbsp;
revealed again, meaning it now overlaps the logo.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.840
We need to adjust the timing of the&nbsp;
bottom text layer to address this.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:34.240
Let’s try an on-stage end&nbsp;
time of 4.7 instead of 5.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.200
That is pretty good.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.160
Alright, it looks like we have the timings&nbsp;
of all our layers now pretty much down.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.920
Getting these timings right&nbsp;
relies on your own judgment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.360
and maybe a few refinement loops&nbsp;
until you’re happy with the result.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.160
Now there are only a few steps left.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.680
The first one is adding a sound layer&nbsp;
since our mockup video has sound.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.560
The sound files are in the archive file&nbsp;
you’ve been given with all the assets.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.080
We need to add an audio layer and keep it&nbsp;
on stage for the entire video duration.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:29.840
And now we can upload our audio file for&nbsp;
this first version of the template night.mp3.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.360
That’s done.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.360
So, the video with its animations is done.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.520
It also has sound now.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.680
The last thing for us to address&nbsp;
is to make it actually dynamic.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.840
How do we do that?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.200
In the data tab, we can select&nbsp;
the feed for this template,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.840
and we choose the feed that we’ve&nbsp;
connected in our previous step.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.560
And now, we can go to our&nbsp;
text layers and replace the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.200
static text in them with a dynamic text element.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.840
Click on the &lt;..&gt; button and select the&nbsp;
column by its name from the source feed.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.560
We’re looking for {{video_dark_top}}.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.800
Then repeat the same process for the bottom text,&nbsp;
but here it’s, of course {{video_dark_bottom}}.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.120
And now we can actually use&nbsp;
the preview function at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.480
top of the editor to flip through&nbsp;
our different videos or cities.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.240
As you can see, the city&nbsp;
name changes in the video.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.640
And for other countries, the entire&nbsp;
language of the text changes.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:53.840
Now we should give our template a proper name.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.880
And finally, we can save it.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.000
We have now created our first template,&nbsp;
the version for night or darkness.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.960
However, the remaining two&nbsp;
versions will be much faster now.
