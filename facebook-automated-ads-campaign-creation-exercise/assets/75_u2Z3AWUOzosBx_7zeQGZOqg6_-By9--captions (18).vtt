00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.630
In the audience tab, we don’t need to adjust
too many things.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:21.110
The age should be changed to 16-49, and we
want to target people interested in “running”.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.990
Since each city can have different weather
conditions and should have different ads active

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.039
based on that, we need one ad set per city.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.770
However, we’re not going to build those
ad sets manually.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.670
(It’s just five ad sets per country, but
already 50 for all ten countries and could

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.630
be hundreds for other setups.)

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.470
Instead, we’re enabling a key Automated
Ads feature called “Automated Targeting

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.829
based on Feed”.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.399
And here, we want to target based on “Cities”
and select our city_targeting field from the

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.449
feed for this purpose.

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.749
You can see the preview value as “New York,
New York, United States”, which Facebook

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:01.989
will use for the ad set targeting.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.540
(It might be another value if you filtered
down to another country.)

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.220
Now Smartly.io gives us a helpful warning
notice.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.180
You're currently using the 'Fixed Ad Sets'
campaign structure.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.620
We recommend switching to the 'Group Ads into
Ad Sets based on product category' campaign

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.560
structure and adding the field city_targeting
to grouping so that each targeting value is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.990
assigned to its own ad set.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.350
If the targeting field is not used in grouping,
each ad set will use all the targeting values

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.180
from the filtered products.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.860
If this raises only more question marks for
you, we’d recommend checking out the linked

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.480
knowledgebase article called “Feed-based
targeting in Automated Ads”.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.800
It explains the Automated Ads campaign structures
in detail.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.050
If the concept is clear, we can address the
issue with just one click.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.440
Now we can go back to the Campaign tab to
see what happened.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.750
Our campaign structure was automatically switched
to “Group Ads into Ad Sets based on product

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.280
category,” and the field to group by was
set to “city_targeting”.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.940
We now have ad sets for Chicago, Houston,
Los Angeles, New York, and Phoenix.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.260
In total, we will create five ad sets.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.500
That’s precisely what we want.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.010
One more thing.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.540
Now that we have this structure in place,
we can also set up our budget.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.390
We can switch from Campaign budget to Ad Set
budget and now use “Value from Feed Field”.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.450
Select the “daily_budget” column from
the drop-down menu, and we’re set.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.200
Now each ad set will be created with the daily
budget as defined in the feed.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.230
We’re done in this tab and can go back to
Audiences.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.590
There’s one more issue highlighted in the
sidebar.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.270
Got the following error(s):

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.900
Locations Can't Be Used - Some of your locations
overlap.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.290
Try removing a location.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.599
The issue here is that we’re currently targeting
the city of New York in the United States…

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.560
...and also the country of the United States.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.430
Those locations overlap.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.730
New York is part of the US.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.640
Facebook doesn’t allow overlapping location
targeting.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.510
We could target New York and the country of
Canada since there is no overlap.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.790
But not a city and the country the city is
located in.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.070
To fix this, we just need to remove “United
States” from the country targeting.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.130
Note that you might not get this error at
all if your ad account default country is

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.970
different from the country you are targeting
in this campaign.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.310
In any case, be sure that you don’t have
additional location targeting on top of the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.209
feed-based targeting.

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.980
Now our audience estimate should be accurate;
for the New York example around 1.3 million

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.980
people.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.140
That’s it for the targeting tab.
