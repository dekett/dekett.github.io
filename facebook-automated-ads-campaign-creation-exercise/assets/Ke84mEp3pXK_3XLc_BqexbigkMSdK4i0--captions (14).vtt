00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.180
Before we start making our fixes and adjustments
to the layers, one more step is required.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:34.070
Let’s import a mockup of our actual video.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.940
Now let’s arrange and resize it.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.190
We can see that this video layer already has
the correct length after import - 5 seconds.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.399
All the imported layers from the PSD, on the
other hand, are set to a default one-second

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.379
duration because the PSD doesn’t contain
any information about animations, transitions,

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.440
or similar.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.700
And if we go through the video, we can see
what is actually supposed to happen.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.320
Looks simple enough, so let’s dig a little
deeper into this.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.110
We are starting with a white background, our
non-glow shoe, and a black logo.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.250
Then immediately, this black slider comes
in from the top, goes behind the shoe, and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.869
the black logo disappears due to the background
being black.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.920
Then shortly before the one-second mark, the
top white text fades in and grows larger.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.689
So two animations are happening at the same
time: a fade and a zoom-in.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.900
And at around the same time, our shoe starts
to glow.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.850
About a second later, the bottom text starts
to appear with the same effect: It fades in

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.460
and zooms in.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.190
This composition stays for a while until,
at the four-second mark, the black slider

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.439
falls out again to the bottom.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.740
Since the white background becomes visible
again, the top white text in front of it disappears.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.120
However, the bottom text fades out right before
the black slider passes it so that the black

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.129
logo is visible again without being overlayed
with the bottom text.

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.590
Around this time, the glow-version of the
shoe also disappears again.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.960
And now this video loops back to the beginning.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.430
Overall not too complicated, but complex enough
for a bit of a challenge.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.620
So let’s hide our video mockup layer and
get started with making the adjustments to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.650
our layers to actually build our video.
