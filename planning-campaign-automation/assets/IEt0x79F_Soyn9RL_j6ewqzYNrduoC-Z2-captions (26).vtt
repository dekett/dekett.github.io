00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.060
What’s the difference between Automated
Ads and Dynamic Ads?

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.790
If we had a dollar for every time, somebody
asked us that question…

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.690
Sorry, we drifted off for a moment.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.850
To answer the question above, we’d rather
ask a different question:

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.789
What do Automated Ads and Dynamic Ads have
in common?

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.310
The answer is that they’re both feed-based.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.050
What do we mean by that?

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.439
“Feed-based” means that the campaign uses
a data source external to both Smartly.io

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.610
and the advertising platform.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.350
To explore that further, we need to take a
look at the essential tool that is available

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.859
to us:
A plain-old regular campaign:

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.100
Here, campaign creation is inherently manual.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.429
Bids, budgets, and audiences are specified
manually.

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.449
Creatives are uploaded manually or manually
selected from the library.

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.030
Creatives are manually mapped to audiences.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.619
Note that ‘manual’ does NOT equal ‘tedious’!

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.620
We have many ways to make it easy, effective
&amp; enjoyable, including templates and cloning,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.580
automatic naming and tracking conventions,
and libraries and bundles.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.520
Certain modifications can be made automatically,
e.g. budgets (via Predictive Budget Allocation),

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.479
bids (via Bid Optimization or custom triggers),
or ad status (via Stop-loss or ad rotation).

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.330
However, only a human can edit existing audiences
and creatives and create new ad sets &amp; ads.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.030
Historically, campaigns like these use static
posts, i.e. the post looks the same to anyone

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.110
who sees it and if you have different creatives
for different audiences, you need to use separate

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.530
ad sets.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.570
To sum it up, regular campaigns are defined
by manual campaign creation using static posts.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.009
That covers our first box, so let’s take
a look at the next one, Asset Customization.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.060
Here, the ad platform adapts the creative
based on the current placement, the user’s

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.979
language, or other personalization based on
interests or other targeting criteria.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.200
These different forms are called Segment Asset
Customization (SAC), Placement Asset Customization

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.649
(PAC), and Dynamic Language Optimization (DLO).

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.510
This adaption means that the same ad can look
different to different users.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.790
This applies not only to copy, images and
videos but also to link destinations.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.000
The advertiser still needs to manually provide
all creative assets (e.g., copy, links, images,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.720
or videos) in a standard setup.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.220
Platforms that support this approach do so
because it leads to broader audiences and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.100
less splitting of ad sets.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.209
It helps them to optimize.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.360
In summary, Asset Customization is still defined
by a manual campaign creation, but the posts

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.190
utilize Dynamic Creatives.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.160
The third box in our toolkit contains Dynamic
Ads:

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.540
Dynamic Ads use the same underlying technology
as Asset Customization, a single ad that displays

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.660
differently for different users.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.159
We collectively refer to this technology as
Dynamic Creative (Optimization - DCO).

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.280
Note that DCO means something different in
the context of Display Advertising.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.319
But back to Dynamic Ads, which is built for
large-scale activity.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.310
You can have a single ad that promotes millions
of products (or flights or hotels – many

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.400
industries are supported).

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.659
The ad platform chooses different products
(or flights, etc.) for each user who sees

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.150
the ad.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.230
It takes them from a catalog.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.780
The catalog is like a table of products.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.800
The ad platform processes it, but the data
is hosted somewhere else, external to the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800
platform.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.780
This is where our (product) feed comes in.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.090
Often, the product data comes from an advertiser’s
e-commerce system.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.030
If an item sells out, for example, the catalog
updates.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.780
When the catalog updates, this affects every
ad using the catalog.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.990
It’s automatic, i.e., no human intervention
is needed.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.560
So Dynamic Ads utilize Dynamic Creatives,
as the name suggests, but the millions of

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.110
potential posts cannot be created manually.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.180
They’re synchronized with a data source.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.280
And finally, the fourth box contains the aforementioned
Automated Ads.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.410
Smartly.io Automated Ads do not require the
use of a catalog on the ad platform.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.070
They do, however, make use of external data
sources.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.020
Catalogs have mostly pre-defined specs, with
little room for flexibility.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.410
But with Automated Ads, you can design your
own feed.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.440
Many Smartly.io customers use a Google Sheet
for their Automated Ads data source.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.870
Update the sheet, and the ads update too.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.460
Automated Ads can also support a wider variety
of creative formats, e.g., video and instant

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.460
experience.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.310
It’s even possible…
…to use Dynamic Creative in Automated Ads.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.030
🤯
More on that some other time.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.560
It gets complicated!

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.280
To summarize it all, our four campaign types
plus Automated Ads with Asset Customization

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.470
neatly slot into a grid.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.780
On the left side, you have campaigns with
static posts.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.480
The created posts are precisely how they appear
to each user who sees the ads.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.750
On the right side, you have campaigns with
dynamic creatives.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.061
What ad variant a user sees is either determined
by a manually created ruleset (e.g. image

00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:26.320
A for feed ads, image B for story ads or text
A for English speakers, text B for Spanish

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.450
speakers, etc.) or determined by Facebook
based on the user's activity (e.g. ad for

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.780
an apartment because similar people have clicked
on apartment ads)

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.440
While static posts come with fewer restrictions
and allow a greater variety of ad formats,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.020
e.g. collection and lead ads, dynamic creatives
often perform better due to their ability

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.460
to show users more relevant content.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.800
At the top, you have campaigns where the individual
assets are manually created.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.210
You need to build the set up the individual
ads or at least the different elements for

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.460
Asset Customization during campaign creation.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.470
At the bottom, you have the campaigns that
are synchronized to a data source or product

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.430
feed, which means the individual assets can
be imported from the data source and save

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.350
manual work.
